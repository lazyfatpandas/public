The installation of Lazy fat Pandas requires installation of two separate packages:
1. SCIRPy - Static Analysis Tool
2. LaFP- Lazy fat Pandas runtime

1. SCIRPy - Static Analysis Tool Installation:
a. Create a module for LaFP_SCIRPy with sciroy-->parsePythonIR-->src as source folder
b. Add all libs from scirpy-->libs to the module
c. Build the artifact
Note: SCIRPy requires jdk 8.0. We have used jdk-8u281-linux-x64


2. LaFP- Lazy fat Pandas runtime Installation:
1st step is to enter the source directory of LaFP i.e. LAFP directory. Assuming you are in the LaFP_SCIRPy folder, run the following commands:
1. cd LAFP
2.  pip install -e .

This will install LaFP as a local package and you will see the following output on the screen in case of successful installation:
"""Installing collected packages: lazyfatpandas
...
